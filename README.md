# SurrealDB data source plugin template

This template is a starting point for building a Data Source Plugin for Grafana.

## What are Grafana data source plugins?

Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, MySQL, and even Datadog. There’s a good chance you can already visualize metrics from the systems you have set up. In some cases, though, you already have an in-house metrics solution that you’d like to add to your Grafana dashboards. Grafana Data Source Plugins enables integrating such solutions with Grafana.

## Development

This project requires **at least Node.js v16** and **at least Go 1.19**.

Version management configuration for Node.js is provided for [`volta`](https://volta.sh/). It is  recommended that you have this installed to automatically switch between Node.js versions when you enter the project directory. This allows for more deterministic and reproducible builds, which makes debugging easier.

You use `volta` to configure the project to use the latest LTS version of Node.js by running:

```bash
volta pin node@lts
```

You can run this command again to update the version.

### Getting started

#### Backend

1. Update [Grafana plugin SDK for Go](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/backend/grafana-plugin-sdk-for-go/) dependency to the latest minor version:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. Build backend plugin binaries for Linux, Windows and Darwin:

   ```bash
   mage -v
   ```

3. List all available Mage targets for additional commands:

   ```bash
   mage -l
   ```

#### Frontend

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode and run in watch mode

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Run the tests (using Jest)

   ```bash
   # Runs the tests and watches for changes, requires git init first
   npm run test

   # Exits after running all the tests
   npm run test:ci
   ```

5. Spin up a Grafana instance and run the plugin inside it (using Docker)

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

6. Run the E2E tests (using Cypress)

   ```bash
   # Spins up a Grafana instance first that we tests against
   npm run server

   # Starts the tests
   npm run e2e
   ```

7. Run the linter

   ```bash
   npm run lint

   # or

   npm run lint:fix
   ```
